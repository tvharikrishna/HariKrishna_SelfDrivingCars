<!-- Introduction to Self-Driving Vehicles -->
<h1>🔻 What are Self-Driving Vehicles? </h1>
<p align='justify'>
A <strong>self-driving vehicle</strong>, also known as an autonomous vehicle, is a car or truck equipped with technology that enables it to navigate and operate without human input. These vehicles utilize sensors, cameras, radar, and artificial intelligence to perceive their surroundings and make decisions to safely reach their destination, transforming the concept of driving and mobility.

<!-- Introduction to Carla Simulator -->
<h1>🔻 What is Carla Simulator? </h1>
<p align='justify'>
The CARLA simulator is a robust <strong>self-driving vehicle simulation</strong> platform developed using the Unreal Engine, aimed at crafting highly authentic virtual training and validation environments for autonomous driving systems. The platform grants access to a wide range of digital assets including urban layouts, buildings, and vehicles etc.

<!-- Details about Carla Simulator's capabilities -->
<p align='justify'>
▸ Carla simulator offers a spectrum of extreme weather conditions such as rain, fog, storms for perception tests.

▸ Traffic patterns reflecting true-to-life situations from crowded city streets and high-speed country roads to unpredictable driving conditions.

▸ Scenarios for critical response training, including unexpected roadblocks and unpredictable actions from pedestrians and other drivers.

<!-- Introduction to The Autoware Foundation -->
<h1>🔻 What is The Autoware Foundation? </h1>
<p align='justify'>
The <strong>Autoware Foundation</strong> is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting open-source projects that facilitate the development of autonomous driving technology. This stack includes tools and libraries designed to offer a comprehensive solution for various autonomous driving needs, from perception to planning and control.
</p>

<!-- Merging both -->
<h1>🔻 Carla x Autoware </h1>
<p align='justify'>
Integrating the <strong>Autoware Foundation's</strong> software with the <strong>CARLA simulator</strong> enhances autonomous vehicle projects by merging real-time autonomous driving capabilities with a robust simulation environment. This combination allows developers to conduct extensive testing and refine vehicle behaviors in a safe, controlled virtual setting, accelerating development and ensuring the reliability of autonomous systems before real-world deployment.
</p>

<!-- Repository Overview -->
<h1>🔻 Repository Detail</h1>
<p align='justify'>
This repository showcases a series of CARLA projects that integrate both <strong>ROS1</strong> and <strong>ROS2</strong> with <strong>Autoware</strong> for pioneering autonomous driving applications. Each project leverages this powerful combination to tackle unique challenges in autonomous systems, demonstrating advanced capabilities in real-time vehicle control, sensory processing, and autonomous navigation.
</p>

<!-- Emphasis on Basics -->
<h1>🔻 Basics are key❗️</h1>
<p align='justify'>
It's essential to have a basic understanding of sensor technology, robotics, in-depth knowledge of computer vision, and the fundamentals of self-driving cars. Below are some of my recommendations I created.
