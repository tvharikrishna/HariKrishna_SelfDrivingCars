# ðŸ”» What is Carla Simulator?

<p align='justify'>
â–¸ The CARLA simulator is an extensive 3D Self Driving Vehicle Simulation built on the Unreal Engine, designed to generate highly realistic virtual environments for the training and validation of autonomous driving systems.

â–¹ CARLA offers open digital assets (such as urban layouts, buildings, vehicles) specifically created for this purpose, available for unrestricted use. The platform enables a flexible setup of sensor suites and provides complete control over all static and dynamic actors, map generation, and environmental conditions. 

It accommodates various
- Diverse weather simulations: rain, fog, wind, snowstorms, and icy conditions.
- Realistic traffic scenarios: urban congestion, rural speedways, highway dynamics, and night-time driving.
- Emergency event handling: road obstructions, vehicle malfunctions, and erratic pedestrian or driver behavior.
