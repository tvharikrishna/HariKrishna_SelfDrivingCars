# ðŸ”» What is Carla Simulator?

<p align='justify'>
â–¸ The CARLA simulator is a robust <strong>self-driving vehicle simulation</strong> developed using the Unreal Engine, aimed at crafting highly authentic virtual training and validation environments for <stgrong>autonomous driving systems</stgrong>.

â–¸ The platform grants access to a wide range of digital assets including urban layouts, buildings, and vehicles, all designed for free and open use. CARLA facilitates adaptable sensor configuration and grants extensive control over both the static and dynamic elements within the simulation, alongside the ability to generate custom maps and varied environmental settings.

â–¸ A spectrum of weather conditions such as rain, fog, snowstorms, and icy environments.

â–¸ Traffic patterns reflecting true-to-life situations from crowded city streets and high-speed country roads to unpredictable highway traffic and nocturnal driving conditions.

â–¸ Scenarios for critical response training, including unexpected roadblocks, vehicle breakdowns, and unpredictable actions from pedestrians and other drivers.
