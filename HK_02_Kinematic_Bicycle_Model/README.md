<p align="center"><h1>🎀 Essence of the Project</h1></p>
<p align='justify'>
The Bicycle Kinematic Model block creates a bicycle vehicle model to simulate simplified car-like vehicle dynamics, representing a vehicle with two axles defined by the length between the axles, known as the `wheel base. The vehicle's heading, theta, is defined at the center of the rear axle, where the front wheel can be steered using an angle psi. <br>
    
This kinematic approach is fundamental in <strong>autonomous driving vehicles</strong> and <strong>autonomous mobile robotics</strong>, enabling accurate motion planning and control by predicting vehicle trajectory and facilitating the implementation of advanced navigation algorithms. </p> <br> <br>

<p align="center"><h1>🎯 Project Vision</h1></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
▸ The Bicycle Kinematic Model is pivotal in autonomous driving and robotics for precise movement planning and execution.

▸ It converts complex vehicle dynamics into a simpler model for trajectory prediction from steering commands.

▸ Essential for path planning and control, it predicts vehicle or robot future positions for smooth navigation and path adherence.

▸ Optimizes trajectories for energy-efficient routing, extending battery life and reducing energy use.

▸ Enhances safety by enabling systems to react to unexpected obstacles or changes, minimizing accident risks.
